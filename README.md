# Get-Tube-Data

## Youtube Data API

This project is a simple tool to retrieve various data utilizing the Youtube Data API at https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3. 

All API requests must specify an API key or utilize the OAuth 2.0 token for specific authorized requests. For our specific purpose we do not utilize the OAuth token to perform requests.

Many different resources are available. Some of these include but are not limited to:

* Activities
* Captions
* Channels
* Comments
* CommentThreads
* Playlists
